 * Remove empty example design text file, x7_sem_mon_fw_v.txt, from being generated in the example project. This file is unnecessary and has no functional impact.

2014.4.1:
 * Version 4.1 (Rev. 3)
 * No changes

2014.4:
 * Version 4.1 (Rev. 3)
 * Added support for xc7a15t, xa7a15t, and xc7z035 devices.
 * Added support for -LI speed grades to all Artix and Zynq 7Z010, 7Z015, 7Z020 Devices
 * Added support for -2LI speed grades to Kintex 7K160T, 7K325T, 7K355T, 7K410T, 7K420T, 7K480T and Zynq 7Z030 to 7Z100 Devices
 * Encrypted source files are concatenated together to reduce the number of files and to reduce simulator compile time

2014.3:
 * Version 4.1 (Rev. 2)
 * Added support for xq7a50t devices.
 * Replaced the icap_clk BUFG with BUFGCE in the example design as an example of a system-level means to delay IP start up until the clock has locked or to disable the IP in debug without modifying the bitstream.

2014.2:
 * Version 4.1 (Rev. 1)
 * Resolved AR 60056. Makedata.tcl is no longer incorrectly displayed as a simulation source file.
 * Resolved AR 60058. Corrected the listed support of xc7a75t, xc7z030, and xc7z015 from Pre-Production to Production.
 * This version of the IP does not yet support new device xq7a50t.

2014.1:
 * Version 4.1
 * Added support for xc7a35t, xc7a50t, xa7a35t, xa7a50t, and xa7a75t devices at Pre-Production status.
 * Replaced injection shim option "ChipScope" with "Vivado Lab Tools".
 * Improved efficiency of behavioral simulation.
 * Added simulation test harness to demonstrate inclusion of the IP in a project using Vivado simulation flows. IP behaviors are not observable in simulation. Hardware-based evaluation is required.

2013.4:
 * Version 4.0 (Rev. 3)
 * This version of the IP does not yet support new Artix devices 7A35T and 7A50T.

2013.3:
 * Version 4.0 (Rev. 2)
 * Increased pblock dimensions in the example design constraint file for Virtex-7 devices to fully contain logic. These pblocks may be manually reduced when integrating the IP into a larger design. Improved packing may reduce the design FIT. (AR47338)
 * Moved pblock closer to the ICAP in the example design constraint file for 7z100 devices to improve timing.
 * Added support for Cadence IES and Synopsys VCS simulators.
 * Added support for xc7a75t, xc7a75tl, and xc7z015 devices.
 * Support for xc7a75t, xc7a75tl, xc7z015, and xc7vh870t devices at Pre-Production status. All other supported devices at Production status.

2013.2:
 * Version 4.0 (Rev. 1)
 * Updated synchronizers to improve Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) for metastability.
 * Reduced pblock dimensions in the example design constraint file for SSI devices to increase logic packing and correct alignment of block memory placement.
 * Increased pblock dimensions in the example design constraint file for non-SSI devices to fully contain logic for correction by enhanced repair. These pblocks may be manually reduced when integrating the IP into a larger design. Improved packing may reduce the design FIT. (AR47338)
 * Resolved AR55370. Modified example design files for SSI devices to eliminate MON shim status report character loss and associated initialization state halt condition.
 * Reduced warnings in synthesis

2013.1:
 * Version 4.0
 * Added support for Zynq-7000 SoCs.
 * Resolved AR47402. Enabled maximum clock frequency of up to 100 MHz in 7 Series devices.
 * Resolved AR53438. Parameterized the EXT shim module to support larger SPI Flash devices. Refer to PG036 for more information.
